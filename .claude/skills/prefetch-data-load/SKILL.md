# Prefetch Data Load Optimization

Apply software prefetch (double-buffering) to overlap async data loads with
compute in FlyDSL GPU kernel loops.

## Core Principle

GPU global memory loads (`buffer_ops.buffer_load`, `buffer_load_dwordx4`)
are **asynchronous** -- the load instruction returns immediately and the
hardware fetches data in the background. The data is only needed when a
subsequent instruction actually **consumes** it. If we issue the load early
enough, the data arrives by the time we need it, effectively hiding the load
latency behind compute work.

**Without prefetch** (load latency fully exposed):

```
for i in range(N):
    data = load(ptr + i)     # <-- stall: wait for data
    result = compute(data)   # <-- cannot start until load completes
```

Timeline:
```
|--load--|--stall--|--compute--|--load--|--stall--|--compute--|
```

**With prefetch** (load overlapped with compute):

```
# Pre-load first iteration BEFORE the loop
next_data = load(ptr + 0)

for i in range(N):
    # Swap: the prefetched data becomes current
    data = next_data

    # Issue load for NEXT iteration (async, non-blocking)
    if i + 1 < N:
        next_data = load(ptr + i + 1)

    # Compute using CURRENT data -- overlaps with next load
    result = compute(data)
```

Timeline:
```
|--load₀--|--compute₀ + load₁--|--compute₁ + load₂--|--compute₂--|
```

The total time drops from `N * (load + compute)` to roughly
`load + N * max(load, compute)`.

## FlyDSL Implementation: `range(..., init=...)` with Loop-Carried Prefetch

In FlyDSL kernels, Python-level `for _pi in range(N)` gets traced into N flat
copies that LLVM re-rolls. This makes the `data = next_data` swap **invisible**
to MLIR — both variables alias the same SSA value, so LLVM hoists loads as
loop-invariant.

**Solution**: Use FlyDSL's runtime `range(..., init=...)` (loop-carried values) to
create genuine SSA phi nodes. See the `flydsl-kernel-authoring` skill, section
"Runtime Loops with Loop-Carried Values", for the full pattern and three critical
pitfalls.

### Transformation Steps

Given a loop like:

```python
for i in range(START, END):
    # === LOAD PHASE ===
    offsets = compute_offsets(i)
    data_A = buffer_ops.buffer_load(rsrc_A, offsets, vec_width=4)
    data_B = buffer_ops.buffer_load(rsrc_B, offsets, vec_width=4)

    # === COMPUTE PHASE ===
    result = rocdl.mfma_f32_16x16x16_f16(transform(data_A), transform(data_B), acc)
```

Apply the following transformation using `range(..., init=...)`:

#### Step 1: Prologue — load first iteration before loop

```python
offsets_0 = compute_offsets(START)
next_data_A = buffer_ops.buffer_load(rsrc_A, offsets_0, vec_width=4)
next_data_B = buffer_ops.buffer_load(rsrc_B, offsets_0, vec_width=4)

init_state = [_unwrap(v) for v in [next_data_A, next_data_B, acc]]
```

#### Step 2: Runtime loop with loop-carried state

```python
_start = fx.Index(0)
_stop = fx.Index(N - 1)  # N-1 iterations; last handled in epilogue
_step = fx.Index(1)

for iv, state in range(_start, _stop, _step, init=init_state):
    # Swap: prefetched -> current
    data_A = state[0]
    data_B = state[1]
    acc = state[2]

    # Prefetch next iteration (async, non-blocking)
    offsets_next = compute_offsets(iv + 1)
    next_data_A = buffer_ops.buffer_load(rsrc_A, offsets_next, vec_width=4)
    next_data_B = buffer_ops.buffer_load(rsrc_B, offsets_next, vec_width=4)

    # Compute using current data (overlaps with next load)
    acc = rocdl.mfma_f32_16x16x16_f16(transform(data_A), transform(data_B), acc)

    results = yield [_unwrap(v) for v in [next_data_A, next_data_B, acc]]
```

#### Step 3: Epilogue — process last iteration

```python
data_A = results[0]
data_B = results[1]
acc = results[2]
acc = rocdl.mfma_f32_16x16x16_f16(transform(data_A), transform(data_B), acc)
```

### Handling auxiliary data (block tables, scales)

Any offset calculations, block table lookups, or scale factor loads needed
for the *next* iteration's data should also be carried as loop state:

```python
init_state = [_unwrap(v) for v in [
    next_data_A, next_data_B, next_block_id, next_scale, acc
]]

for iv, state in range(_start, _stop, _step, init=init_state):
    data_A, data_B, block_id, scale, acc = state

    # Prefetch next iteration
    next_block_id = load_block_table(iv + 1)
    offsets_next = compute_offsets(iv + 1, next_block_id)
    next_data_A = buffer_ops.buffer_load(rsrc_A, offsets_next, vec_width=4)
    next_data_B = buffer_ops.buffer_load(rsrc_B, offsets_next, vec_width=4)
    next_scale = buffer_ops.buffer_load(rsrc_scale, next_block_id, vec_width=1)

    # Compute with current data
    acc = rocdl.mfma_f32_16x16x16_f16(
        transform(data_A) * scale, transform(data_B), acc
    )

    results = yield [_unwrap(v) for v in [
        next_data_A, next_data_B, next_block_id, next_scale, acc
    ]]
```

### PA Decode Kernel Example (verified, 112us, 0.75x vs Gluon)

State inventory (15 values carried across iterations):
- 8 x `vector<4xi32>` — K data (4 tiles x 2 loads)
- 1 x `i32` — partition_start
- 2 x `i32` — block table values (phys_block/page_off or phys_0/phys_1)
- 2 x `f32` — running_max, running_sum (online softmax)
- 2 x `vector<4xf32>` — PV accumulators

```python
# Pack/unpack helpers
def _pack(kv_flat, part_start, bt_vals, rmax, rsum, acc_pv):
    raw = kv_flat + [part_start] + bt_vals + [rmax, rsum] + acc_pv
    return [v.ir_value() if hasattr(v, 'ir_value') else v for v in raw]

def _unpack(state):
    kv_flat = list(state[0:8])
    kv = [[kv_flat[t*2], kv_flat[t*2+1]] for t in range(4)]
    return kv, state[8], list(state[9:11]), state[11], state[12], [state[13], state[14]]

# Prologue
pf_0 = issue_bt_k_loads(partition_0)
init_state = _pack(flatten(pf_0['kv']), pf_0['part_start'], ...)

# Runtime loop (bounds MUST be fx.Index, not Python ints!)
for iv, state in range(fx.Index(0), fx.Index(N - 1), fx.Index(1), init=init_state):
    kv, part_start, bt, rmax, rsum, acc = _unpack(state)
    rmax, rsum, acc = compute_qk_softmax_pv(kv, part_start, bt, rmax, rsum, acc)
    pf_next = issue_bt_k_loads(next_partition(iv + 1))
    results = yield _pack(flatten(pf_next['kv']), pf_next['part_start'], ...)

# Epilogue: clear SmemPtr caches, compute last partition, write output
smem_ptr._view_cache = None
kv, part_start, bt, rmax, rsum, acc = _unpack(results)
compute_qk_softmax_pv(kv, part_start, bt, rmax, rsum, acc)
write_output(rmax, rsum, acc)
```

**ISA result**: 8 K-prefetch `buffer_load_dwordx4` appear at the END of the
loop body (after PV MFMA), overlapping with the MFMA pipeline drain. The
prologue has 8 K loads before the loop. The epilogue has 8 V loads only (no
K loads needed).

### Three Critical Pitfalls

1. **Loop bounds must be `fx.Index(...)`, NOT Python ints.** If you write
   `range(0, 15, 1, init=...)`, the AST rewriter treats constant bounds as a
   Python `range` and unrolls the loop — silently ignoring `init=`. Use
   `fx.Index(0)`, `fx.Index(15)`, `fx.Index(1)` instead.

2. **Prefer internal types; unwrap only at hard boundaries.** Most loop-carried
   values can remain `fx.Int32`, `fx.Float32`, `ArithValue`, or `Vector`. If a
   low-level helper explicitly expects raw `ir.Value`, unwrap at that boundary.

3. **Clear `SmemPtr._view_cache` before epilogue.** `SmemPtr.get()` caches the
   view it creates. If called inside the runtime loop body, the cached
   view is defined in the loop scope. Using it in the epilogue (outside the loop)
   causes an SSA dominance error. Fix:
   ```python
   my_smem_ptr._view_cache = None
   ```

## Applicable Patterns

This optimization applies whenever you see this pattern in a kernel:

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `for ... in range(N)` loop with `buffer_load` followed by MFMA | Load-then-compute in a loop body |
| Block table lookup inside loop | `buffer_load(block_table_rsrc, idx)` followed by `buffer_load(cache_rsrc, page_id * stride)` |
| KV cache iteration | Paged attention, flash attention, any tiled GEMM with paged memory |
| Scale factor loads | FP8 per-token quantization scales loaded per KV block |

## Compiler Constraints

FlyDSL kernels compile to GCN ISA where `s_waitcnt` insertion is controlled by
the **compiler**, not by the programmer. You cannot directly eliminate `s_waitcnt`
instructions. Instead, prefetch restructures the code so the compiler places
`s_waitcnt` after enough compute work to hide the latency.

### Register Budget

**Always check register headroom before adding prefetch buffers:**

On CDNA3 (gfx942 MI300X/MI308), VGPRs are tracked as two **physical** files that
share **one combined 512-entry occupancy budget** per SIMD:
- **arch_vgpr** (up to 256 per SIMD): used by VALU, VMEM loads, LDS ops, and prefetch buffers
- **accum_vgpr / AGPR** (up to 256 per SIMD): used by MFMA result writeback

Prefetch buffers physically live in **arch_vgpr** and MFMA accumulators in
**accum_vgpr**, but occupancy is governed by their **sum** (`arch_vgpr +
accum_vgpr`), so growing prefetch buffers *does* compete with MFMA accumulators
for the shared 512 budget and can cost occupancy.

```python
# Estimate arch_vgpr cost of prefetch buffers:
#   - Each buffer_load_dwordx4 = 4 arch_vgpr per load
#   - 8 K-cache loads = 8 x 4 = 32 arch_vgpr for one buffer set
#   - Double-buffering = 2 x 32 = 64 arch_vgpr (but one set is reused)
#   - Net additional arch_vgpr ~ 32 (the "next" buffer)
#
# On MI300X (gfx942): arch_vgpr + accum_vgpr share ONE combined 512 budget/SIMD
# Occupancy = 512 / (arch_vgpr_alloc + accum_vgpr_alloc) waves per SIMD
# (combined-pool model — NOT 256/max; that was gfx908/CDNA1 only)
#
# Example: arch=148, accum=148 -> combined 296 -> 512//296 = 1 wave
# Adding 32 arch_vgpr -> combined 328 -> still 1 wave (safe)
# To reach 2 waves you need combined (arch+accum) <= 256
# arch+accum > 512 -> SPILL (exceeds the combined per-SIMD budget)
```

**Critical thresholds (gfx942, combined arch+accum budget):**
| Combined arch_vgpr + accum_vgpr | Max Waves/SIMD | Impact |
|--------------|---------------|--------|
| <= 128 | 4 | High occupancy |
| <= 170 | 3 | Good occupancy |
| <= 256 | 2 | Moderate occupancy |
| <= 512 | 1 | Minimum occupancy |
| > 512 | **SPILL** | Register overflow -> severe perf regression |

**How to check current VGPR allocation** (from rocprofv3 database):
```sql
SELECT ks.KernelName, ki.arch_vgpr_count, ki.accum_vgpr_count
FROM rocpd_kernel_dispatch kd
JOIN rocpd_info_kernel_symbol ks ON kd.kernel_symbol_id = ks.id
JOIN rocpd_info_kernel ki ON kd.kernel_id = ki.id
WHERE ks.KernelName LIKE '%target_kernel%'
LIMIT 5;
```

**WARNING**: Do NOT use `maxnreg` to force `accum_vgpr=0` in hopes of freeing
register space for prefetch. This forces MFMA results through arch_vgpr via
`v_accvgpr_read` spills, causing massive slowdown (measured 4.5x GPU kernel
regression).

### What Prefetch Can and Cannot Do

**CAN do:**
- Restructure the loop so `buffer_load` is issued earlier via `range(..., init=...)` loop-carried values
- The compiler will then schedule the corresponding `s_waitcnt` further from the load
- Overlap next iteration's loads with current iteration's MFMA compute

**CANNOT do:**
- Directly control `s_waitcnt vmcnt(N)` counter values
- Force the compiler to use `vmcnt(N>0)` instead of `vmcnt(0)`
- Eliminate barriers (`s_barrier`) — these come from explicit `gpu.barrier()` or cross-wave reduce primitives

### Hoisting Loads into Barrier-Wait Regions

A powerful technique specific to multi-phase kernels (like paged attention with
softmax reduce):

If a kernel has a phase that spends time in `s_barrier` waits (e.g., softmax
cross-wave reduce), and the **next** phase needs data from global memory (e.g.,
V-value loads), hoist those loads into the barrier-stalling region. The barrier
must wait regardless — issuing loads during that wait is essentially free.

```python
# BEFORE: V-value loads happen AFTER softmax reduce completes
softmax_reduce(qk_scores)  # <-- 96K stall cycles in barriers
v_data = buffer_ops.buffer_load(rsrc_v, offsets, vec_width=4)  # <-- additional load latency

# AFTER: V-value loads issued BEFORE/DURING softmax reduce
v_data_prefetch = buffer_ops.buffer_load(rsrc_v, offsets, vec_width=4)  # <-- async, non-blocking
softmax_reduce(qk_scores)  # <-- barrier stalls now overlap with v_data fetch
v_data = v_data_prefetch  # <-- data likely already arrived
```

This works because:
- `buffer_load` returns immediately (async)
- The barrier stalls are **dead time** where no useful work happens
- By the time barriers complete (~96K cycles), the V-value load (~17K cycles)
  has long since arrived

## Rules and Pitfalls

### Do
- **Prefetch ALL data** needed for the next iteration: keys, values, scales, block table entries
- **Place prefetch loads** immediately after the swap, BEFORE any compute that consumes current data
- **Use `range(..., init=...)`** to carry prefetched data across iterations (Python variable swap is invisible to MLIR)
- **Minimize work between load and consume**: the more compute between prefetch issue and data use, the better the overlap
- **Keep the swap simple**: just unpack from `state`, no computation
- **Check VGPR budget**: calculate `current_arch_vgpr + prefetch_vgprs <= 256` to avoid spills
- **Hoist cross-phase loads into barrier regions**: if a kernel has barrier-heavy phases (reduce/sync), issue the next phase's loads before/during those barriers
- **Unwrap all init values to raw ir.Value**: use `v.ir_value() if hasattr(v, 'ir_value') else v`

### Don't
- **Don't prefetch if loop body is already memory-bound**: prefetching helps when compute (MFMA) duration >= load latency. If the loop is purely loads with no compute, prefetching won't help.
- **Don't prefetch too many buffers**: each prefetched variable occupies registers. If register pressure is already high (causing spills), prefetching more data makes it worse. Check `waves_per_eu` / occupancy.
- **Don't assume occupancy can increase**: on MI308 with 512 max VGPRs, adding prefetch buffers that push total VGPRs above 256 will drop occupancy from 2 to 1 wave/SIMD. This may or may not be acceptable — profile both configurations.
- **Don't reorder loads that have data dependencies**: if `load_B` depends on the result of `load_A` (e.g., block table lookup -> cache load), they must stay sequential within the prefetch block.
- **Don't forget to handle conditional branches**: if scale loads are conditional (`KV_QUANT_MODE`), the prefetch must replicate the same conditions.
- **Don't break the prologue/epilogue semantics**: the prologue covers iteration 0; the runtime loop runs N-1 iterations carrying prefetched data; epilogue processes the last iteration from `results`.
- **Don't use Python ints as loop bounds when using `init=`**: use `fx.Index(...)` or the loop will be unrolled, silently ignoring `init=`.

## Verification

After applying prefetch:

1. **Correctness**: Run the existing test suite. Output must match bit-for-bit (fp32 accumulation) or within tolerance (fp8/bf16).
2. **Performance**: Profile with `rocprofv3 --kernel-trace`. Look for:
   - Reduced `VMEM` stall cycles in the loop body
   - Higher MFMA utilization percentage
   - Overall kernel duration reduction
3. **Register pressure**: Check that `waves_per_eu` (occupancy) didn't drop. If it did, consider prefetching fewer buffers (e.g., only keys, not values).

## When NOT To Use

- **Single-iteration loops** (`range(1)`): no next iteration to prefetch
- **Compute-bound kernels**: if MFMA utilization is already >90%, the bottleneck is compute, not memory — prefetching won't help
- **Very high register pressure**: if occupancy is already 1 wave/EU and the kernel spills, adding prefetch buffers will make it worse
